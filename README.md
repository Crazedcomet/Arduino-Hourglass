My next Arduino project once again uses hardware and software to present, the hourglass.
Using the tilt sensor, I havce created a stopwatch that lights up every 10 minutes for a total of 60 minutes (1 hour).
Once you are done with the hourglass (all lights are on) simply turn the the tilt switch over and restart the countdown!
